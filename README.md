Project Summary: 

In this project data was sourced from Kaggle to get 4 weeks data of Uber and Lyft services in New York city.
In addition I sourced data from Open Weather Map API.

This is an analysis of Uber and Lyft, the top contenders of the cab sharing app market, and how they compare with each other. The project explores the various factors such as weather & price that lead to people using the cab sharing services. 
Machine Learning Algorithms are used to predict the determining factors that lead to surge pricing.
